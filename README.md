#FizzBuzz

To run the application:

```shell
php index.php -h
```

This will print the help message, displaying the options.

If you want to print out the numbers as per the challenge:

```shell
php index.php -p
```

You can also override the default number (100) by attaching an integer right after the "p" option

```shell
php index.php -p200
```
